            Mastana is an annual South Asian variety showcase run by the students of Cambridge University. We put on display an array of different South Asian talent including dance, music, comedy, theatre, food and more, alongside raising money for charity. In the run-up to our showcase, we hold a variety of fundraising events such as mehendi evenings, Bollywood movie nights, South Asian snack sales and cultural games nights. All proceeds from our events and our showcase are donated to our partner charities.
